<br> 4. Correctly picking the face will give that player 1 point <br> 5. Correctly picking the face and value will be worth 3 points 
<br> 6. If any portion of the guess is incorrect, the card is randomly placed back into the card pile and no points are assigned <br> 7. If the player gets 1 or 3 points, that card is removed from the pile 
<br> 8. There will be a new card on top after every guess based on the remaining cards in the 20 card pile <br> 9. After each guess, it becomes the other players turn to guess on a card
<br> 10. If there is a tie after all 20 cards are guessed, the game will continue until the a player gains 3 more points, with no chance for rebuttal by the other player</b>
